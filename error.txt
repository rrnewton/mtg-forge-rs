Task: Find and fix missing MTG features by testing old_school decks

Status: In progress

Issue found: Mono black deck (05_mono_black_rogerbrand.dck) causes infinite loop error:
"Priority round exceeded max actions (1000), possible infinite loop"

This happens with seed 456 when playing heuristic vs random.

Next steps:
1. Debug the infinite loop - likely a priority system bug
2. OR implement a simpler missing feature like upkeep triggers for Land Tax
3. OR implement exile-based removal like Swords to Plowshares

The infinite loop is the most critical issue but may be hard to debug without more context.
Upkeep triggers would enable many cards but is complex (requires phase trigger system).
Exile removal is simpler but still requires SubAbility chaining.

Recommendation: Fix the infinite loop bug first as it blocks gameplay.
