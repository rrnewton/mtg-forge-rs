================================================================================

It looks like we have lots of methods that take a player ID as an EntityID: `get_player_zones`, `Card::new`, etc. This is rather weakly typed. EntityID is used for many different kinds of entities---cards, players etc.

Before we go further let's refactor this so that we use distinct types for these different uses of `EntityID` and get a type error otherwise. They can all share the same 
physical representation of an unboxed integer.

We can accomplish this by making EntitID take a "phantom type parameter", e.g. `EntityID<Player>`. That indicates which kind of entity it as an ID for, using the actual type (`Player`) of the entity that will be looked up. This makes entity lookup strongly typed, because an `EntityID<T>` will resolve to a `T`.

Then, for the common types we can introduce type aliases as shorthand:

```
PlayerID = EntityID<Player>
CardID = EntityID<Card>
(etc..)
```

Note I have also updated Claude.md to reflect the emphasis on strong typing and include some extra requirements on validation and commit messages.
