[2025.10.19] {Additional prompts beyond the original setup}
================================================================================

It looks like we have lots of methods that take a player ID as an EntityID: `get_player_zones`, `Card::new`, etc. This is rather weakly typed. EntityID is used for many different kinds of entities---cards, players etc.

Before we go further let's refactor this so that we use distinct types for these different uses of `EntityID` and get a type error otherwise. They can all share the same 
physical representation of an unboxed integer.

We can accomplish this by making EntitID take a "phantom type parameter", e.g. `EntityID<Player>`. That indicates which kind of entity it as an ID for, using the actual type (`Player`) of the entity that will be looked up. This makes entity lookup strongly typed, because an `EntityID<T>` will resolve to a `T`.

Then, for the common types we can introduce type aliases as shorthand:

```
PlayerID = EntityID<Player>
CardID = EntityID<Card>
(etc..)
```

Note I have also updated Claude.md to reflect the emphasis on strong typing and include some extra requirements on validation and commit messages.


-------------------------------- 

I also noticed weakly typed indices into maps:

```
pub subtypes: SmallVec<[String; 2]>,
```

Let's get rid of all of those and use more specific types (enums, newtypes, or at least aliases).


Implement and test the undo functionality
----------------------------------------

First, a minor refactor. In ModifyLife let's rename `amount` `delta` instead so it is clear it is an increment/decrement and not an absolute amount.

Next, let's finish and test this undo log. It looks like the types are there, but that it is not actually USED by the game logic. Let's start to remedy that. We need to insure that EVERY mutable method on `GameState` (i.e. which takes a `&mut self`) also adds to an UndoLog stored in the `GameState`. Ensure this is the case. Then, as a first test, at the end of the lightning bolt example, report the length of the undo log and print the list of actions stored in it.


TODO: Add all the counter types
----------------------------------------

Our `CounterType` is currently a newtype wrapper around a String. This is not faithful to `CounterEnumType` in the Java implementation. An enum is more efficient than a string, more complete, and more typesafe. Port the entire `CounterEnumType` over to an analogous enum in our Rust codebase.


CURRENT INTERNAL TODO
----------------------------------------

    ✻ Refactoring ModifyLife… (esc to interrupt · ctrl+t to hide todos)
      ⎿  ☐ Rename amount to delta in ModifyLife action
         ☐ Add UndoLog field to GameState
         ☐ Add undo logging to all mutable GameState methods
         ☐ Print undo log at end of lightning bolt example

Implement more of an engine driving the game with callbacks
-----------------------------------------------------------

Right now our `lightning_bolt_game.rs` example directly mutates the game by calling a series of methods on it (play_land, tap_for_mana, cast_spell, etc).

We need to move toward a state where the engine drives the game and the player (AI or human) drives the CHOICES through either a UI (such as the text UI) or through an API.

Let's start to move towards that. The lightning bolt example should
