Begin or progress work on simple interactive TUI
------------------------------------------------------------

The basic `mtg tui --p1=tui` will be very similar to the Java version. Instead
of making a random choice for every `Enter choice (0-N)` prompt, we will present
the choice to the user and wait for input on stdin.

Later we will add a fancy TUI with the ratatui library, so we should keep an eye
on how to make our Controller interface generic. It will present the battlefield
and the choices in a different way.


TODO: Randomized stress tests with invariants for snapshot resume
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can see how to play some number of turns, and stop and resume randomly.
Build an e2e test script (under tests/) which stresses the system. This script can be in python and we can extend the e2e test script runner to run both .py and .sh files in that directory.

For a list of test decks (initially just grizzly bears and royal assassin):
 For both random/random and heuristic/heuristic modes:
 - Play a game with the deterministic seed and count the turns,
   choices, and log of choices made by P1/P2.
 - Play the same game stop-and-go, with players switched to fixed controllers
    - advance a random count of choices, 1-5, passing in fixed inputs
    - snapshot, resume, repeat until game end

 - Examine the collected logs of both the original and stop-and-go runs.
   - Filtering for relevant game actions (draw card, spell resolves, etc),
     the logs should match EXACTLY. The differences are only extra messages around stopping/resuming.
   - Make sure the final game 

If this works, you can make the test go even deeper by adding a `--save-final-gamestate=file` flag which will save the end-of-game state of play
to a snapshot file. When both run modes produce a final file, we can do a
deep comparison to make sure they match. Perhaps we can get the serialized text files to EXACTLY match, but there may be good reasons to ignore certain bits of state in the comparison instead.
