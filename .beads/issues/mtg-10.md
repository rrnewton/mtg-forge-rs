# Description

Many small Vec allocations for temporary collections:
- game_loop.rs:418 (player_ids collection)
- combat.rs:90,95 (attackers/blockers lists)

Return iterators instead of Vec where possible.

# Notes

Completed in commit 0d6cdb50. Replaced player_ids Vec with fixed array and cards_to_untap Vec with SmallVec. Combat allocations already addressed in 60d257e1.
