# Description

The heuristic AI has concerning behavior:
- It loses to random controller (random won 20-0 vs heuristic at 0 life)
- Games end by decking with no damage dealt
- Heuristic 'chose not to block' even in clearly winning positions
- Example: 'chose not to attack with 2 available creatures' when it should be attacking

Need to review:
1. Attack decision logic in heuristic_controller.rs
2. Block decision logic
3. Combat math calculations
4. Why it's so passive

Test case:
```bash
cargo run --bin mtg -- tui test_decks/white_aggro_4ed.dck test_decks/white_aggro_4ed.dck --p1=heuristic --p2=random --seed=42
```

This is separate from the snapshot/resume determinism issues.
