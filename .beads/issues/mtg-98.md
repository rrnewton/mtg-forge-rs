# Description

This is just a convenience feature for me using the `mtg tui` on the command line.

## Implementation (2025-10-28)

âœ… Completed - commit 12ae142

Changes:
- Made PLAYER2_DECK optional in TUI command arguments
- If omitted, PLAYER1_DECK is used for both players
- Updated help text to clarify usage
- Added informative message when using same deck

Usage:
```bash
# Single deck for both players
mtg tui decks/simple_bolt.dck --p1=random --p2=random

# Still works with two decks
mtg tui decks/simple_bolt.dck decks/vigilance_deck.dck
```
