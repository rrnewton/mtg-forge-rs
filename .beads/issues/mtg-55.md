# Description

When cards fail to load from the cardsfolder, the error messages should be more descriptive.

Current behavior: Generic "failed to load card" message
Desired behavior: Show which field failed to parse, line number, and suggested fix

This will save debugging time when adding new cards.


Add profile command to CLI
