# Description

Royal Assassin test reveals that activated abilities don't support targeting yet.

Current status:
- ✅ Priority during combat works (MTG Rules 508.4)
- ✅ Royal Assassin's ability is loaded from card database
- ✅ get_activatable_abilities() correctly finds the ability
- ✅ HeuristicController.choose_best_spell() now considers activated abilities
- ❌ Activated abilities use placeholder targets instead of asking controller to choose

What needs to be implemented:
1. In game_loop.rs ActivateAbility handler (line ~1425):
   - Get valid targets for the activated ability
   - Ask controller to choose targets (similar to spell targeting)
   - Replace placeholder targets in effects with chosen targets
   
2. Add get_valid_targets_for_ability() method to GameState
   - Similar to get_valid_targets_for_spell()
   - For Royal Assassin: filter for tapped creatures
   
3. Test with Royal Assassin scenario:
   - Royal Assassin should target Grizzly Bears (tapped attacker)
   - Grizzly Bears should be destroyed
   - Test should verify Bears in graveyard
