It's not great to have them digging around ./target and randomly picking a debug or release binary that may be stale.

Adding `cargo run` only adds about 60ms.  Test that only run it once or a few times should do that.

Tests that run the mtg binary many times should call `cargo build --release` and then directly call the binary from ./target.
