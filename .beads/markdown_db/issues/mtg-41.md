# Description

Ensure controller API is consistent and well-documented:
- Uniform naming conventions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Document contract between game loop and controllers
- Examples for each controller type

# Resolution

**Completed** - Updated CONTROLLER_DESIGN.md with comprehensive documentation (2025-10-27).

## What was documented:

1. **Complete trait interface**: Full PlayerController trait definition with all methods
2. **Key design principles**:
   - Unified spell ability selection (matches Java Forge)
   - Correct mana timing (step 6 of 8 casting process)
   - GameStateView for read-only access
   - Zero-copy principles with slices and SmallVec

3. **All 6 implementations documented**:
   - RandomController - Seeded random decisions
   - ZeroController - Always first option (deterministic)
   - HeuristicController - Evaluation-based AI (Java port)
   - FixedScriptController - Pre-recorded decisions
   - InteractiveController - Human player via stdin/stdout
   - ReplayController - Snapshot/resume replay

4. **Java Forge compatibility**: Side-by-side comparison showing how Rust design matches Java
5. **GameLoop integration**: Examples of how game loop calls controllers
6. **Testing approach**: Description of controller tests
7. **Future enhancements**: MCTS, neural networks, learning controllers

## API consistency verified:

✅ **Naming conventions**: All methods use `choose_*` pattern consistently
✅ **Separation of concerns**: GameStateView provides read-only access, controllers make decisions
✅ **Contract documented**: Clear explanation of when each method is called in game flow
✅ **Examples provided**: 6 different controller implementations serve as examples

The documentation now accurately reflects the current unified PlayerController trait design.
