We were working on fixing a single bad commit (a0ed94c3 on main). Once we are fully validating on the `stop-replay` feature branch, then that branch should replace `stable`.

At that point we are ready to continue integrating changes from main to stable. We will already have a substitute for a0ed94c3, which has been fixed on the stable branch. Commits afbb716d to b2b05259 on main represent newer changes that need to be reintegrated one at a time. For each commit:
* cherry pick it, fix any conflicts
* make sure it passes full validation (`make validate`)
* push it to stable and move on to integrating the next commit
