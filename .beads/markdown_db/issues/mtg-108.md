We don't curerntly load all 6692 .dck files in the forge-java tree.
This task is to:
- incrementally increase the number of decks we load, by adding support for features, and
- reduce the `max_allowed_failures` in `test_load_cards_and_decks` to represent the progress.

In the commit message of 28012e7e9fd5f7137107f93593f814a7bf0bd72d you can see
some of the documented limitations that lead to our deck loading failures.
