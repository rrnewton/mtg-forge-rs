We don't curerntly load all 6692 .dck files in the forge-java tree.
This task is to:
- incrementally increase the number of decks we load, by adding support for features, and
- reduce the `max_allowed_failures` in `test_load_cards_and_decks` to represent the progress.

In the commit message of 28012e7e9fd5f7137107f93593f814a7bf0bd72d you can see
some of the documented limitations that lead to our deck loading failures.

Specific example: add two sided cards
----------------------------------------

One of our failed decks is this:

```
=== Failed Decks (1730) ===
1. Card 'Rona, Herald of Invasion' in deck forge-java/forge-gui/res/geneticaidecks/GAS_31_Dennick, Pious Apprentice based deck_53_0.dck not found in database
```

Which uses a two sided card that can be found in this file:
`cardsfolder/r/rona_herald_of_invasion_rona_tolarian_obliterator.txt`

When we fix two-sided-card loading, this should be fixed.
