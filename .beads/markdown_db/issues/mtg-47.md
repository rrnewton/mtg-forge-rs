# Description

Implement heuristic board evaluation:
- Material count (creature P/T, card advantage)
- Life total differential
- Board position (attacking vs defending)
- Mana advantage
- Card quality weighting
Foundation for tree search AI.

## Resolution (2025-10-26)

This functionality is already implemented in `GameStateEvaluator` (src/game/game_state_evaluator.rs).

**Implementation:**
- Evaluates life totals with configurable weight (default 3 points per life)
- Evaluates hand card advantage (7 points per card)
- Evaluates battlefield with comprehensive creature evaluation
- Evaluates land quality and mana base
- Returns Score type with WIN/LOSS constants for terminal states

**Capabilities:**
- Material count: Creature evaluation uses power/toughness/keywords
- Life differential: player_life - opponent_life with weighting
- Board position: Comprehensive battlefield evaluation
- Mana advantage: Evaluates land quality and mana production
- Card quality weighting: Uses HeuristicController's creature evaluation

The evaluator is used by HeuristicController for attack/block decisions and provides the foundation for future tree search implementations.
