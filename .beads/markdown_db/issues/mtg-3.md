# Description

Track implementation of Magic: The Gathering game mechanics.

## HOWTO make progress on this task.

Your primary method of making progress and adding more MTG compatibility is this:

* Pick real decks and run real games (`mtg tui` subcommand).
* Read logs carefully and question the relationship to (1) MTG rules, and (2)
  whether the AI actions make some basic level of sense.
* As the agent, have the full experience that I will have while playing games
  with our engine (stop/resume games to explore particular choice points).

For now, use the test decks under `decks/` including `decks/old_school` when
doing your testing. You can pick random decks and do manual testing in order to
FIND an issue, but then you should add a test that demonstrates the problem and
do a piece of work that makes the test pass.
