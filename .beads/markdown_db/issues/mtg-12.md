# Description

Review ManaEngine operations for unnecessary cloning of mana costs.
Seen in game_loop.rs:106,277 (mana_cost.clone()).

# Resolution

**Already resolved** - investigated and found no mana_cost clones in the codebase.

Verification performed 2025-10-27:
- Searched `/workspace/src/game/mana_engine.rs` for `.clone()` calls: **0 found**
- Searched `/workspace/src/game/game_loop.rs` for `mana.*clone`: **0 found**
- The line numbers mentioned (106, 277) are outdated
- ManaEngine is already optimized with no unnecessary cloning

This optimization was likely completed in earlier refactoring work.
