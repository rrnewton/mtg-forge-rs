# Description

## Problem

Players are starting games with 0 cards in hand instead of drawing their opening 7-card hands. This violates MTG Comprehensive Rules 103.4.

## Evidence

From game logs:
```
Turn 1 - Alice's turn
Alice (active): 
  Life: 20
  Hand: 0 | Library: 60 | Graveyard: 0 | Exile: 0
```

Both players start with empty hands and only draw during their regular draw steps.

## Root Cause

In `src/game/game_loop.rs`, the `setup_game()` function (lines 359-408) shuffles libraries but does NOT draw opening hands. The function should:

1. Shuffle each player's library (✓ already done)
2. Draw 7 cards for each player (✗ MISSING)
3. Handle mulligans (✗ not implemented, but can defer)

## Impact

- Players play entire games with 7 fewer cards than intended
- Dramatically affects game strategy and AI decision-making
- Invalidates game testing and benchmarks
- Makes all recorded games non-standard

## Fix Location

Need to add code in `game_loop.rs` `setup_game()` function around line 405, after shuffling:

```rust
// Draw opening hands (MTG Rules 103.4)
for &player_id in &player_ids {
    for _ in 0..7 {
        self.game.draw_card(player_id)?;
    }
}
```

## MTG Rules Reference

From Comprehensive Rules:
- **103.4** Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven.
- **103.5** Players may mulligan (can implement later)
