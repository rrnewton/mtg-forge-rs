# Description

We want to retain the ability to deterministically test by controlling RNG
seeds. But sometimes we may want to sample many DIFFERENT games from the space
of all possible games between two decks.

To this end, in addition to `--seed` let's have a separate `--deck-seed`. If not
provided, it is initalized from the main seed. If it is provided, then the deck
seed is used only for the initial random decisions before the game starts
(shuffling) and the --seed can be varied independently to sample different runs
of the same game while keeping the inital hands the same.

This will be useful for testing if one agent can be "smarter" and win under the
same conditions that another loses.

Also --seed currently takes numbers only. If it is passed "clock" then let's
seed the RNG from the system clock using real entropy in the usual way.
