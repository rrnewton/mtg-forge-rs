# Description

Split the stress test into:
1. A script that tests one deck (snapshot_stress_test_single.py)
2. A shell script that calls the first script in parallel using gnu parallel

This will allow faster testing of multiple decks and make it easier to run individual deck tests during debugging.

Example:
```bash
./run_stress_tests.sh royal_assassin white_aggro_4ed grizzly_bears
```

Should use gnu parallel like other scripts in the project.
