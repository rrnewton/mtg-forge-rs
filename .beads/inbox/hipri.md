Push through support for `monored.dck` deck
-------------------------------------------
What it means to make a at all usable is:
- the cards load
- random play works

But to FULLY support a deck and make it playable through the TUI:
- mechanics on all cards work
- the heuristic AI can play it somewhat reasonably
- all choices are presented correctly to the controller

You can use all the tools at your disposal to do this.
- prefer E2E experiments with the actual mtg binary, it's easier
  for us to be mislead about what works when not using the full `tui`
