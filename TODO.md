### Extra tasks added by human

 - [x] Elide random choices with one option only
   - ‚úÖ RandomController no longer logs when there's no meaningful choice (single target, exact mana sources needed, etc.)
 - [ ]    


### Next Priorities:

- [ ] **Enhanced TUI features**
  * ‚úÖ Add random controller support (--p1=random)
  * Add interactive TUI controller (--p1=tui) for human play
  * Display game state during play (life, hand, battlefield)
  * Show available actions to player
  * Better formatting and colors in output

- [ ] **Enhanced creature support**
  * ‚úÖ Summoning sickness tracking
  * ‚úÖ Vigilance keyword
  * ‚úÖ Trample keyword
  * ‚úÖ Lifelink keyword
  * ‚úÖ Deathtouch keyword
  * ‚úÖ Flying/reach for combat restrictions
  * ‚úÖ Multiple blockers support
  * ‚úÖ Damage assignment order
  * ‚úÖ First strike / Double strike combat damage
  * ‚úÖ Menace keyword (requires at least 2 blockers)
  * ‚úÖ Hexproof keyword (can't be targeted by opponents)

- [ ] **More card types**
  - [x] Creature cards (combat, summoning sickness, keywords)
  - [x] Enchantment cards (basic support - can cast and enter battlefield)
  - [x] Artifact cards (basic support - can cast and enter battlefield)
  - [ ] Aura enchantments (need enchant targeting)
  - [ ] Equipment artifacts (need equip abilities)
  - [ ] Planeswalker cards (lower priority)

- [ ] **Ability system expansion** (see CARD_SCRIPT_SPEC.md for full DSL documentation)
  - [x] Keywords (K:) - Flying, First Strike, Protection, Madness, Flashback, Enchant, etc.
  - [x] Basic DealDamage parsing (A:SP$ DealDamage with NumDmg$)
  - [x] Draw spell effects (A:SP$ Draw with NumCards$)
  - [x] Destroy spell effects (A:SP$ Destroy with ValidTgts$)
  - [x] GainLife spell effects (A:SP$ GainLife with LifeAmount$)
  - [x] Pump spell effects (A:SP$ Pump with NumAtt$/NumDef$)
  - [x] Tap/Untap spell effects (A:SP$ Tap, A:SP$ Untap)
  - [x] Mill spell effects (A:SP$ Mill with NumCards$)
  - [ ] More spell effects (A:SP$) - Counter
  - [ ] Activated abilities (A:AB$ with Cost$) - tap abilities, mana abilities
  - [x] Triggered abilities (T:) - ETB triggers with Draw and DealDamage effects (basic support)
  - [ ] Static abilities (S:) - continuous effects
  - [ ] SVar resolution (DB$ sub-abilities)

- [ ] **Complex targeting**
  - [ ] Target validation (legal targets)
  - [ ] Target selection by controllers
  - [ ] "Any target" vs creature-only vs player-only

## üìã Phase 4: Performance & Tree Search (LATER)

### Performance:
- [ ] Criterion benchmarks for key operations
- [ ] Undo/redo performance testing
- [ ] **Optimization work** - See [OPTIMIZATION.md](OPTIMIZATION.md) for best practices and backlog
  - Zero-copy patterns (avoid clone/collect where possible)
  - Arena allocation for per-turn temporaries
  - Object pools for reusable objects
  - Heap profiling to identify allocation hotspots
- [ ] Board state evaluation speed
- [ ] Tree search optimization

### AI & Search:
- [ ] Implement undo() to rewind game state
- [ ] Tree search using undo log
- [ ] Basic board state evaluator
- [ ] MCTS or minimax search implementation
- [ ] Measure boardstates-per-second

---

## üìù Phase 5: Advanced Features (FUTURE)

### More Game Mechanics:
- [ ] Stack interaction (responding to spells)
- [ ] Counterspells and instant-speed interaction
- [ ] Card draw triggers and replacement effects
- [ ] Discard mechanics
- [ ] Graveyard interactions
- [ ] Token creation
- [ ] +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on creatures
- [ ] Equipment and Auras

### Serialization & Testing:
- [ ] GameState text file format (.pzl files)
- [ ] Load game states from files for testing
- [ ] Puzzle mode for testing specific scenarios
- [ ] Replay recorded games

### Advanced Performance:
- [ ] Fast binary game snapshots (rkyv)
- [ ] Parallel game search
- [ ] SIMD optimizations where applicable

## üêõ Known Issues

None currently - all tests passing!

**Recently Fixed:**
- ‚úÖ AI vs AI infinite loop (RandomController kept tapping lands indefinitely)

---

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization Backlog

### Recently Completed:
- ‚úÖ **Eliminated player ID collect() calls** in game loop hot paths
  - Replaced 10+ `collect()` calls with direct iterator access
  - Used `.find()` instead of collecting Vec then indexing
  - **Result:** Fresh mode 1.2-2.2% faster, Snapshot mode 11-13% faster
  - Files: game_loop.rs, main.rs, benches/game_benchmark.rs

### High Priority - Allocation Hot Spots:
- [ ] **CardDatabase::get_card() returns references** (Major)
  - Currently clones CardDefinition on every access (line 52, database_async.rs)
  - Heaptrack shows this as top allocation site
  - Requires adding lifetime parameters to return `&CardDefinition`
  - Would eliminate ~50% of Card struct clones

- [ ] **Eliminate GameStateView clones** (Medium)
  - Created on every controller decision
  - Consider borrowing instead of cloning where possible

- [ ] **String allocation optimization** (Medium)
  - Card names, player names cloned frequently
  - Consider using Arc<str> or &'static str where appropriate
  - Log messages allocate heavily - consider conditional compilation

### Lower Priority - Legitimate Uses:
- These collect() calls are necessary for borrow checker but documented for awareness:
  - reset_turn_state (line 298): collect player IDs before mutating
  - untap_step (line 357): collect card IDs before mutating
  - get_next_player (state.rs:247): could optimize for 2-player case

### Measurement Notes:
- Benchmark before: Fresh ~162¬µs/game, Snapshot ~166¬µs/game
- Benchmark after: Fresh ~159¬µs/game, Snapshot ~147¬µs/game
- Heaptrack showed ~4GB allocations per 10k games before optimizations
