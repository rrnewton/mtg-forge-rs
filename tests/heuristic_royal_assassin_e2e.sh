# E2E test for HeuristicController - Royal Assassin tap ability (FUTURE)
#
# This test is a PLACEHOLDER for future implementation.
#
# Test scenario:
# - Player 1 (heuristic AI) has Royal Assassin (untapped) on battlefield
# - Player 2 declares attacker (tapped creature during combat)
# - Verify that Royal Assassin taps to destroy the attacking creature
#
# REQUIREMENTS (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED):
# 1. HeuristicController needs to handle activated abilities
#    - Currently only handles spells and attacks
#    - Need to add activated_ability decision logic
# 2. Royal Assassin's AB$ Destroy ability is parsed (✓)
#    - Card loader parses: A:AB$ Destroy | Cost$ T | ValidTgts$ Creature.tapped
#    - Creates DestroyPermanent effect
# 3. Game loop needs to offer activated abilities as choices
#    - During priority passes
#    - Especially during opponent's combat phase
# 4. HeuristicController needs to evaluate when to use Royal Assassin
#    - Prioritize killing high-value attacking creatures
#    - Consider whether we can profitably block instead
#    - Don't waste on small creatures if bigger threats exist
#
# IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP:
# Phase 1: Add activated ability handling to game loop
#   - Offer non-mana activated abilities during priority
#   - Ensure they go on the stack correctly
#
# Phase 2: Add activated ability decision logic to HeuristicController
#   - evaluate_activated_abilities() method
#   - For destroy abilities: prioritize high-power/valuable creatures
#   - For tap abilities: check if creature is untapped and can be used
#
# Phase 3: Create this test
#   - Use either PZL puzzle or custom deck setup
#   - Verify Royal Assassin destroys attacking creature
#
# RELATED FILES:
# - src/game/heuristic_controller.rs: Add activated_ability methods
# - src/game/game_loop.rs: Offer activated abilities during priority
# - src/loader/card.rs:779-784: AB$ Destroy parsing (already done)
# - examples/activated_ability_demo.rs: Shows how activated abilities work
