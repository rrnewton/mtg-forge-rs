# E2E test for HeuristicController - Grizzly Bears attacking

# This test verifies that the HeuristicController will attack with Grizzly Bears
# when the opponent has no blockers on the battlefield.
#
# Test scenario:
# - Player 1 (heuristic AI) has Grizzly Bears on battlefield
# - Player 2 has no creatures (cannot block)
# - Verify that Grizzly Bears attacks
