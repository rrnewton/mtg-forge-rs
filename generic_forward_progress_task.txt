Now you select a task to make forward progress. Review the context:

 - TODO.md
 - CLAUDE.md
 - Game rules: rules/02_mtg_rules_condensed_medium_length_gemini.md
 - PROJECT_VISION.md
 - Relevent feature of the source material, Java implementation: ./forge-java

Then select a task, make forward progress, and commit it after `make
validate` passes. As described in the project vision, the goal is to
keep expanding the implementation until the full game of MTG is
playable, including all cards and arbitrary decks, including the 6690
.dck files in forge-java/.
