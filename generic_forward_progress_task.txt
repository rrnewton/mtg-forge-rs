We're going to work on a task. But before we do let's make sure we
start in a clean state. Check that we have no uncommitted changes in
our working copy. Perform `git pull origin main` to make sure we are
starting with the latest version. Check the github actions CI status
for the most recent commit and make sure it not red (if it's still
pending, ignore and proceed). If there's a CI failure, then fixing
THAT becomes our task. Finally, check that `make validate` passes
locally in our starting state.

Now we're ready to select a task to make forward progress. Review the context:

 - TODO.md
 - CLAUDE.md
 - Game rules: rules/02_mtg_rules_condensed_medium_length_gemini.md
 - PROJECT_VISION.md
 - Relevent feature of the source material, Java implementation: ./forge-java

Then select a task, make forward progress, and commit it after `make
validate` passes. As described in the project vision, the goal is to
keep expanding the implementation until the full game of MTG is
playable, including all cards and arbitrary decks, including the 6690
.dck files in forge-java/.

If you become completely stuck, write the problem to "error.txt" before you exit.

If you are successful, and `make validate` passes, then commit the
changes. Finally, push the changes (`git push origin main`). If there
are any upstream commits, pull those and merge them (fixing any merge
conflicts and revalidating) before pushing the merged results.
